# Train Scheduler
Week 7 Assignment

Heroku:

Train Scheduler is an app that uses a firebase database to store train scheduling information. The user can add a train name, destination, first train time and frequency and see the results append to the table in the "Current Train Schedule" section. The app will calculate minutes until the next train and how many minutes away that train is.
